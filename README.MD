So, heres my implementation of The Royal Game of Ur.

<b>Reason</b>: I saw the game on youtube and thought "I bet I can make that in javascript"... so I did.
<b>Outcome</b>: Index.html and indexsound.html. No external images or sounds. Uses Jquery.

More info can be found on the wiki (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Game_of_Ur): but heres a quick overview of the rules

<b>Rules</b>:
There are 2 players. Each player gets to throw 4, 4 sided dice.

Each player has 7 counters which have to travel the board until it exists the board (on the right hand side).
There are 3 lanes, 2 of which interact with each other.

<pre>
[1][1][1][1]S     E[1][1]  <-- Player 1s entry lane
<- <- <- <- 1      <- <-

-> -> -> -> -> -> -> ->
[A][A][A][A][A][A][A][A]  <-- Attack Lane
-> -> -> -> -> -> -> ->

[2][2][2][2]S    E[2][2]  <-- Player 2s entry and exit lane
<- <- <- <- 2     <- <-
</pre>

Player one enters the board at the top of the screen (shows as S), player 2 enters the board at the opposite side (shown 
above as E).
The path of the Player starts in their safe zones, the counters on these first 4 tiles cannot be taken by the other player.
If you throw a 3 for example you can move to the 3rd starting lane position. If you throw a 2 from this point you could either
move the first counter another 2 spaces (and move in to the attack lane) or select a new counter which will then move on the 
2nd starting lane space.
They then move up the attack lane. At this point players can take other player's counters, which are sent back to their start 
position when "taken".
If a counter reaches the exit lane on the right it cannot be taken and is theoretically safe. Side note: "theoretically": although
it cannot be taken, you will have to throw a specific number to move the dice off the board i.e if the player is on the 1st of the
2 exit quares they MUST throw either a 1 to move it to the last sqaure, or a 2 to allow it to exit the board. If neither of these
are thrown then player loses their shot until they can move. This also happens at other points in the game. Make sure you always
have enough space to move or you;ll lose your turn ;)

Special Squares: The sqaure that looks like the red and black pettles are free shot squares i.e. you get to roll the dice
again. Also, the pettle in the attack lane cannot be taken, so if someones one it, you cannot take that square.

Only one counter is allowed on each sqaure.

You CAN throw a 0.
